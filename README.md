## Brainaut DeFi 
On the Binance Smart Chain, Brainaut is a 3rd generation reflectionary,
deflationary, yield Farm token. 

## How it works
A 4% fee is charged for each transaction, 2 % of
every BSC transaction is redistributed over all holders and the remaining 2% is
burned. Thus, Brainaut has the ability to reflect and burn tokens instantly.


## Total and max supply 
The total supply begins with 100,000,000 tokens, when the total supply reaches
10,000,000 BRN, fees will not be charged, to insure the Brainautâ€™s durability on
listing with a constant max supply of 10,000,000 tokens.
